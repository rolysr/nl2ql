This query will return a list of movies directed by Jan Troell.

543,What are the films on [elmore leonard],"Since the schema does not specify a clear relation between the movie and the phrase ""elmore leonard"", it is not possible to directly generate a Cypher query. The query would depend on whether ""elmore leonard"" refers to a director, writer, actor, tag, or any other attribute. 

For example, if ""elmore leonard"" is a writer, the Cypher query would be:

```
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:WRITTEN_BY]->(w:Writer)
WHERE w.name = ""elmore leonard""
RETURN m.name

Or if ""elmore leonard"" is a tag, the Cypher query would be:
