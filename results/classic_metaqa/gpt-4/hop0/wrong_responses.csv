The query would depend on whether ""elmore leonard"" refers to a director, writer, actor, tag, or any other attribute. 

For example, if ""elmore leonard"" is a writer, the Cypher query would be:

```
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:WRITTEN_BY]->(w:Writer)
WHERE w.name = ""elmore leonard""
RETURN m.name
```

Or if ""elmore leonard"" is a tag, the Cypher query would be:

```
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:HAS_TAGS]->(t:Tag)
WHERE t.name = ""elmore leonard""
RETURN m.name
```

The exact Cypher query can only be provided if the context of ""elmore leonard"" is specified."
