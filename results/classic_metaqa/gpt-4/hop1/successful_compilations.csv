It could mean films directed by the same director, written by the same writer, having same actors, released in the same year, having same language, tags, genre, votes or rating. 

Considering it's about sharing the same director, the Cypher query could be:

```cypher

It could refer to sharing the same director, actors, writers, genre, etc. Assuming it refers to sharing the same director, the Cypher query would be:

```cypher
MATCH (m:Movie {name: ""Grown Ups""})-[:DIRECTED_BY]->(d:Director)<-[:DIRECTED_BY]-(sharedMovies:Movie)
RETURN sharedMovies.name
```

This query first finds the Movie with the name ""Grown Ups"", follows the DIRECTED_BY relation to its Director, and then finds any other Movies that are also directed by the same Director. The names of these shared movies are then returned. 

If ""share"" refers to a different attribute, such as genre or actors, replace `DIRECTED_BY` with the appropriate relationship, such as `HAS_GENRE` or `STARRED_ACTORS`."

However, if we assume ""co-directors"" as directors who have directed the same movies, we can do this by finding movies directed by Luchino Visconti and then finding other directors of those movies. 

Here's a possible Cypher query:

```
MATCH (d:Director {name: 'Luchino Visconti'})<-[:DIRECTED_BY]-(m:Movie)-[:DIRECTED_BY]->(cd:Director)
WHERE d.name <> cd.name
RETURN DISTINCT cd.name
```

This query first matches movies directed by Luchino Visconti, then finds other directors of those movies. The condition `d.name <> cd.name` is used to exclude Luchino Visconti from the result. Finally, `RETURN DISTINCT cd.name` is used to return the names of the co-directors, making sure each name appears only once in the result."

4879,when films directed by the release of [Takeshi Kawata],1990,"The given natural language query seems to contain a misunderstanding. The phrase ""when films directed by the release of [Takeshi Kawata]"" does not make sense semantically. It appears to be asking for films directed by a person (Takeshi Kawata) and somehow involving a release, but the phrasing is unclear. 

If you're trying to find out the movies directed by Takeshi Kawata and their release years, the Cypher query would be:

```
MATCH (m:Movie)-[:DIRECTED_BY]->(d:Director {name: 'Takeshi Kawata'}), (m:Movie)-[:RELEASE_YEAR]->(y:Year)
RETURN m.name, y.name
```

This query finds all movies (`m`) that are directed by a director (`d`) named Takeshi Kawata and also gets their associated release years (`y`). The results include the names of the movies and their release years."

9960,which films share with [Bruce Almighty],High Strung|Nothing to Lose|Evan Almighty|Click|Barnyard,"This query is a bit ambiguous because it does not clarify what ""share"" means in the context of ""which films share with Bruce Almighty"". There could be many interpretations, for example, it could mean:

1. Which films share the same director as Bruce Almighty?
2. Which films share the same writer as Bruce Almighty?
3. Which films share the same actors as Bruce Almighty?

I will assume that ""share"" means sharing the same director.

```Cypher

Assuming ""Double Happiness"" is a movie name, the Cypher query could look for other movies directed by the same director, written by the same writer, or starring the same actors. However, without further information, it's not possible to provide a precise Cypher query. 

An example of a Cypher query finding movies directed by the same director as ""Double Happiness"" would be:

```
MATCH (m:Movie {name: ""Double Happiness""})-[:DIRECTED_BY]->(d:Director)<-[:DIRECTED_BY]-(m2:Movie)
RETURN m2.name

This query first finds the movie ""Double Happiness"", finds the director of that movie, and then finds all other movies directed by that same director. The names of these movies are then returned.

Please provide more context or specify what ""Double Happiness"" refers to in order to get a precise Cypher query."
